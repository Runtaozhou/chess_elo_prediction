1. How to access the full data. 

The full .pgn data set is available at the following file path: 

file_path = '/scratch/zrc3hc/lichess_db_standard_rated_2024-08.pgn'

2. Filtered Dataset for "Rated Blitz game" Games

For initial model creation and testing, I have saved a same of 1000 "Rated Blitz game" games in a seperate file for easier access:

file_path = '/scratch/zrc3hc/filtered_bullet_games_first_1000.pgn'

3. Future Steps.

Later wil will need to filter and saving additional "Rated Blitz game" games from the full dataset.
